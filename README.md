### 👋 Hi there, glad you're here

#### 🔭 I'm available to hire or collaborate! 🔭

### 😎 What can I do

I'm all about making the web look awesome and function smoothly! From crafting beautiful HTML5 and CSS designs to bringing them to life with <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>TypeScript</b> magic, I've got you covered. 

Whether it's adding that extra flair with SCSS and SASS or diving deep into frameworks like <b>React</b> and <b>Vue</b>, I'm here to make your projects shine. I've even dabbled in cool animation stuff with GSAP and Three.js!

🥸 On the side, I've tinkered with a bunch of other tech too, like Node.js and SQL, and I've played around with design tools like Figma and Adobe XD.
