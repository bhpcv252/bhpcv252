### 👋 Hi there, glad you're here

#### 🔭 I'm available to hire or collaborate! 🔭

### 😎 What can I do

I'm a seasoned <em>web developer</em> with a knack for crafting stunning frontend and rock-solid backend solutions. Over the years, I've had the privilege of collaborating with notable clients like Equinox and Tlnthub, bringing their digital visions to life with my expertise.

Right now, I'm diving deep into the exciting worlds of machine learning and iOS development. It's a wild ride, but I'm loving every moment of it. There's something incredibly satisfying about learning new skills and pushing the boundaries of what I can do.

🥸 On the side, I've tinkered with design tools like Figma, Adobe XD and Photoshop.
